    "## Greenhouse Gas Feedback Mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "Greenhouse gas feedback mechanisms are processes that either amplify or dampen the effects of greenhouse gases on the Earth's climate. These feedbacks are critical in understanding climate sensitivity and how the Earth's temperature responds to increasing levels of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide ($\\text{CO}_2$), methane ($\\text{CH}_4$), and water vapor ($\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Positive Feedback: Water Vapor Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most significant positive feedback mechanisms is the water vapor feedback. As the Earth's temperature increases due to the greenhouse effect, more water evaporates into the atmosphere. Since water vapor is itself a greenhouse gas, this increases the greenhouse effect and leads to further warming.\n",
    "\n",
    "The change in the amount of water vapor ($\\Delta \\text{WV}$) can be approximated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta \\text{WV} \\propto \\Delta T\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\Delta T$ is the change in temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "This relationship implies that a small increase in temperature can lead to a significant increase in water vapor, amplifying the initial warming.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Negative Feedback: Infrared Radiation Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "A primary negative feedback mechanism involves the Earth's radiation to space. As the Earth's surface warms, it emits more infrared radiation ($I_{\\text{IR}}$) according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "I_{\\text{IR}} = \\sigma T^4\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\sigma$ is the **Stefan-Boltzmann constant** ($5.67 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\text{Wm}^{-2}\\text{K}^{-4}$).\n",
    "- $T$ is the **absolute temperature** of the Earth's surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "As $T$ increases, $I_{\\text{IR}}$ increases, allowing more heat to escape into space, which acts to cool the Earth and counteract the warming.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Modeling of Feedbacks\n",
    "\n",
    "To model the net effect of feedbacks on the Earth's temperature, we can use the following feedback factor $f$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f = \\frac{\\Delta T_{\\text{final}}}{\\Delta T_{\\text{initial}}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\Delta T_{\\text{initial}}$ is the initial temperature change due to a forcing (e.g., an increase in $\\text{CO}_2$).\n",
    "- $\\Delta T_{\\text{final}}$ is the final temperature change after accounting for feedbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $f > 1$, the feedback is positive (amplifying the effect), while if $f < 1$, the feedback is negative (damping the effect).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Implementation of Feedback Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "We can simulate the effects of feedbacks on Earth's temperature using a simple Python model. Below is an example code to illustrate how different feedback factors influence the final temperature change.\n"
